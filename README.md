ITP Dynamic Web Development 2024 Spring, Assignment #2.

## About
Update: Add hover interactions & change font to Helvetica.__
I made a poster based on the relative location of the northest station (start station) of every subway line in New York City. The position is abstracted and not 100% true to geographic location!
