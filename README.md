# A New York Poster
ITP Dynamic Web Development 2024 Spring, Assignment #2.

## About
I made a poster based on the relative location of the northest station (start station) of every subway line in New York City. The position is abstracted and not 100% true to geographic location!

## Setup

**Using VS Code:**
1. Download all files in a folder.
2. Open the folder in VS Code.
3. Make sure to install Live Server or Live Preview in Extentions
4. Run command "Live Server: Open with Live Server" or "Live Preview: Start Server" to view.

**Through git & Terminal:**
1. In Terminal, `cd` to desired directory location.
2. Clone this repo to local `git clone https://github.com/lqiuuu/new-york-poster.git.`
3. Start local server `python3 -m http.server` or `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`, or similar command based on environment.
4. Go to the returned http address in browser.
5. `control + c` to stop the server.
